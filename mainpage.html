        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome and thanks for checking out my theory about how the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
                split the Zelda Timeline into three timelines. After the release of the Hyrule Historia and the
                establishment of an official timeline, I found myself discontent with their explanation of time timeline
                split and went searching for answers. I found some good, thought provoking theories and expanded on them
                to make one of my own. At the bottom of this page, there is a form to leave feedback; I'd love to hear
                what you think of my theory!
