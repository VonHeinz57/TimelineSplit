Welcome to my theory on how Ocarina of Time split the Zelda timeline into three pieces.

This is a passion project that is being used for my project for the Front End Web Development Course in Code Louisville. It is a web article detailing some background information on the game, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, commonly accepted fictitious time travel rules, and my theory on why the game split the Zelda timeline into three pieces.

For the article, I drew a lot from the Completionist's theory on youtube. My main contribution was adding why it didn't split at another point in the game. With respect to the styling, I drew from various news articles and blogs to look for what would look 
best in terms of spacing and photo additions.


For the project, I've implimented the following elective features:

    1) CSS: A navigation menu in tablet and desktop views. In a tablet view, the navigation menu is a vertical list below the title. In desktop view, there will be a list of tabs under the title.
    
    2) CSS: Use :nth child to change the background color for specific sections.

    3) JavaScript: Create and validate a form. Mine validates that the name and comment are not blank and that the email has a "@" symbol that is not the first character, a "." after the "@" symbol, and at least "co" after the ".".

    4) JavaScript: Show/hide content using a button. This functionality is present in mobile view. You click to open each subsection of the article.

    5) (maybe) CSS: The nav menu uses flexbox and changes orientation as the screen size changes.
