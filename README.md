Welcome to my theory on how Ocarina of Time split the Zelda timeline into three pieces.

This is a passion project that is being used for my project for the Front End Web Development Course in Code Louisville. It is a web article detailing 
some background information on the game, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, commonly accepted fictitious time travel rules, and my theory on why 
the game split the Zelda timeline into three pieces. For the article, I drew a lot from the Completionist's theory on youtube. My main contribution was 
adding why it didn't split at another point in the game. With respect to the styling, I drew from various news articles and blogs to look for what would look 
best in terms of spacing and photo additions.


For the project, I've implimented the following elective features:

    1) CSS: Using flexbox to organize ontent areas based on mobile or desktop views (yet to come, I'm wrapping up the mobile design now)
    
    2) CSS: Use :nth child to change the background color for each section.

    3) JavaScript: Create and validate a form. Mine validates that the name and comment are not blank and that the email has a "@" symbol 
        that is not the first character, a "." after the "@" symbol, and at least "co" after the ".".
